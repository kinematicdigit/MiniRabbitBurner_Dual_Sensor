# Ministealthburner_Dual_Sensor
BETA Mini Stealthburner remix with dual sensor

(https://github.com/kinematicdigit/Ministealthburner_Dual_Sensor/blob/main/media/image.png)

Remix and optimized the Mini Stealthburner with dual sensors for use with ERCF. The filament path has been optimized for heavy load and unload duty cycles. Remixed filament path for a more stable structure to handle the loading of heavily curved filaments and new wire channels for managing the new sensor wires.

BOM (in addition to standard Mini Stealthburner BOM)
(2)x Omron D2F-5L, D2F-01F, or D2F-01L Micro Switch
(1)x MR85ZZ bearings
(3) coloured 28AWG wires
(2)x M2x10mm SHCS or BHCS
2 interconnects for your breakout board.
