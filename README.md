# Ministealthburner_Dual_Sensor
BETA Mini Stealthburner remix with dual sensor

Remix and optimized the Mini Stealthburner with dual sensors for use with ERCF. The filament path has been optimized for heavy load and unload duty cycles. Remixed filament path for a more stable structure to handle the loading of heavily curved filaments and new wire channels for managing the new sensor wires.
